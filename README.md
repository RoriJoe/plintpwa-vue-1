# Project description
This repo contains the code that accompanies the blog post you can read here
https://www.blog.plint-sites.nl/progressive-web-app-using-vue-cli-3/

It's a simple PWA created using the @vue/cli with the pwa plugin. It uses the
Notifications API to show a notification when you click the green button
